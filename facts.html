    <h1>Why Random Forest?</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Random Forest is a robust machine learning algorithm that excels at classification tasks 
            by combining the results of multiple decision trees. 
            It works well with large datasets and can handle both numerical and categorical data. Most importantly 
            it is able to give us detailed information on feature importance, allowing us to find specific patterns in the data.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Key Advantages of Random Forest</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Handles missing data and outliers effectively.</li>
        <li>Reduces overfitting through the ensemble approach.</li>
        <li>Provides feature importance scores to understand influential factors.</li>
        <li>Works well with high-dimensional data and non-linear relationships.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Importance of Features</h1>
    <p>
        Below is the feature importance for predicting tree health, determined by the Random Forest model:

        These feature importances highlight the critical factors affecting tree health, such as Disturbance_Level, 
        Gleason_Index, and Tree_Height.
